This file describes my emacs setup.

The configuration currently has the following layout:

~/.emacs.d/:
init.el
init/keyb.el       - keyboard bindings
init/lang.el       - language support
init/modeline.el   - modeline customisation
init/org.el        - org-mode setup
init/osx.el        - OS X specific options
init/settings.el   - general settings
init/ui.el         - UI specific options

The file ~/.emacs.d/init.el replaces ~/.emacs - emacs looks in both
these locations for its initialisation file.
